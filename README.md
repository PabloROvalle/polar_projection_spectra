# polar_projection_spectra


Way to plot JWST data by using navigated fits and project them in a polar grid.
This code generates an interpolation in order to fill all the blank spaces between the dots. This routine is useful only for the interpolation. It needs the Central Meridian in order to do a correct plot, and the image generated is not a good representation of a perfect paper figure, but only the interpolated image is what matters here.
